General Formula Calculator

Context:
The purpose of this program is to provide users with a tool to easily calculate interest, quadratic equations, or mean quickly and efficiently. 
This is important when solving higher level problems where you can save time by using a calculator instead of manually calculating the outcome which may introduce wrong answers.

Description:
User will be prompted on which formula to use on start, and then will be prompted on the values of each item in the said formula. 
The result of the calculation will be printed onto the screen for the user to see, as well as a prompt asking if the user would like to use a different formula or not. 
“Y” will result in the code restarting, prompting for the formula, and “N” will result in the code exiting.

Version 1 code: 
https://github.com/ChrissyAFK/MesoProject 
in: V1.java

Feedback:
Some of the bugs that the user encountered in V1 was when inputting a wrong character into the prompts asking for number values, 
they would get an error message causing the program to quit. I was also told that some of the outputs were not that clear due to the large decimals.
